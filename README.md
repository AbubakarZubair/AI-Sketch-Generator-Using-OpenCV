# 🎨 AI Sketch Generator Using OpenCV

A simple yet effective Python project that uses the OpenCV library to convert images into realistic pencil sketches.  
The project processes an input image through a series of computer vision techniques including grayscale conversion, image inversion, Gaussian blurring, and division blending to generate a clean sketch effect.
