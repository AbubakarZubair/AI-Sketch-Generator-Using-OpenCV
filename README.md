# 🎨 AI Sketch Generator Using OpenCV

A simple yet effective Python project that uses the OpenCV library to convert images into realistic pencil sketches.  
The project processes an input image through a series of computer vision techniques including grayscale conversion, image inversion, Gaussian blurring, and division blending to generate a clean sketch effect.

## 📦 Features

- 📷 Convert any image into a pencil sketch
- 🌗 Grayscale conversion and image inversion
- 🌫️ Gaussian blur for smooth sketch shading
- 📝 Custom text watermark on the final sketch
- 💾 Saves the processed sketch image with a new filename
- 🪟 Resizable display windows for all image stages
- 🔍 View intermediate image processing steps (grayscale, inverted, blurred, etc.)

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Sketch-Generator-Using-OpenCV.git
   cd AI-Sketch-Generator-Using-OpenCV
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

bash
